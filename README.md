Citizen Service app for Project Deep Blue (2016)


This was a project built for the 3 month long Deep Blue Project Hackathon.
The problem statement was to build a multi lingual Android app, that would auto recognize images of garbage, potholes, and traffic. 

Built over a course of a week and a half with @CCD-1997.
