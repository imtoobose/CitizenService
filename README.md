# CitizenService
Citizen Service app for Project Deep Blue (2016)


This was a project built for the 3 month long Deep Blue Project Hackathon.
The problem statement was to:

- build a multi lingual Android app, that would auto recognize images of garbage, potholes, and traffic. 
- allow users to post and view pictures of the above issues
- Notify users when the SLA of a problem was over

Built over a course of a week and a half with [CCD-1997](https://github.com/CCD-1997)
